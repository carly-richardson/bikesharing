# NYC CitiBike with Tableau
An analysis of CitiBike NYC bikesharing data from August,2019 with visualizations created using Tableau.

## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis will answer the following questions:

 - The number of trips taken.
 - The number of bikes that were used.
 - The demographic of customers.
 - The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
 - The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
 - The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
There were 13,983 CitiBikes used for 2,344,224 trips in August, 2019 in New York City. Approximately 81% of the trips were taken by subscribers and approximately 65% of the trips were taken by male-identifying users.

The majority of trips taken are less than 30 minutes long.

Monday through Friday, the highest number of trips occur during 8:00 am - 9:00 am and again from 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm. This indicates that the majority of the trips are being taken by local commuters to and from work. On the weekends, the number of rides is spread pretty evenly throughout the daytime hours. This trip behavior is mirrored in all genders.

There are additional visualizations on Tableau Public, and they tell a consistent story to the visualizations seen in this written analysis.

## Summary
The majority of NYC CitiBike's revenue comes from male-identifying subscribers. The vast majority of trips taken are less than 30 minutes long. This information tells me that the maximum distance between bike stations should be around a 10 to 15 minute commute. Additionally, Monday through Friday the peak number of trips occur during morning and evening commute times. On the weekends, the number of trips is spread fairly evenly throughout the day. From the information discovered in this analysis, I would place a large number of bike stations in areas with heavy concentrations of residents and office buildings. To further understand how to implement a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa, I would create visualizations to show the most popular bike stations and what percentage of all bike trips they account for. I would also look at the percentage of total users by birth year to compare to the demographic of Des Moines.
